1. Create a Single Page Application (SPA) with an Input Form to Take a `userId` from the Browser
- HTML Structure:
  - The `index.html` file includes an input form where users can enter a `userId` and a button to fetch the data.

 2. Display User Name, Email, Address, and All Posts Belonging to This `userId`
- Fetching and Displaying User Information:
  - The `fetchUserInfo(userId)` function in `app.js` fetches and displays the user's name, email, and address.
- Fetching and Displaying User Posts:
  - The `fetchUserPosts(userId)` function in `app.js` retrieves all posts for the specified `userId` and appends them to the DOM in a single operation for efficiency.

 2.1. Retrieve All Posts from the Selected User (`/posts?userId=1`)
- Code Implementation:
  - The `fetchUserPosts(userId)` function sends an Ajax request to the `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId=${userId}` endpoint to retrieve all posts for the selected user and then displays them in the DOM.

 2.2. For Every Post, Include a Button (Show Comments), Upon Clicking the Button Show All Comments for the Specific Post (Optional)
- Button to Show Comments:
  - Each post includes a "Show Comments" button generated by the `fetchUserPosts(userId)` function.
  - Clicking this button triggers the display of comments for that specific post using the `fetchComments(postId)` function.

 2.2.1. Retrieve All Comments from the Selected Post (`/comments?postId=1`)
- Code Implementation:
  - The `fetchComments(postId)` function is implemented within the event handler for the "Show Comments" button.
  - It sends an Ajax request to `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments?postId=${postId}` to retrieve comments for the specified post.

 2.2.2. Hide `postId` in Data-Attribute in Each Post
- Code Implementation:
  - The `postId` is stored as a data attribute in each "Show Comments" button (`data-postid="${post.id}"`), making it easy to retrieve and use when fetching comments.

 2.2.3. Consider Using Event Delegation for the List of Posts
- Code Implementation:
  - Event delegation is handled using `$(document).on('click', '.showComments', function () {...})`. This ensures that event handlers work correctly even for dynamically added content.

 2.2.4. Use `$(DOM).on()` to Attach Event Handlers to Newly Created Elements
- Code Implementation:
  - The `$(document).on()` method is used to attach the event handler to dynamically created "Show Comments" buttons, which ensures that the event handler works for all buttons, including those added after the initial page load.

 Complete Overview
The solution includes all necessary functionality for a fully working SPA that meets the provided requirements, from capturing the `userId`, retrieving user data and posts, to dynamically displaying comments for each post. All interactions are handled via Ajax, ensuring that the application remains a true SPA without full page reloads.
